Sadly, there are no easy docker setup instructions available.

Setup a simple network with dnsmasq as dhcpv6 server. Run any dhcpv6 client on the clients machine and obtain the network packets. Look for the server identifier inside the dhcpv6 packets. Then, run the poc on the client:
# python /poc.py  <ipv6 addr> <server id, hexencoded>
The poc will create a response.bin file with 32k bytes worth of ram, beginning at the buffer + 38.

If DNS cache is enabled in dnsmasq, the attacker can steal this cache.
